## Next Steps (June 6, 2025)

Based on our recent progress implementing database persistence, fixing workflow execution issues, and improving code quality, here are the recommended next focus areas:

### Immediate Focus (Next Week)
1. **FastAPI Modernization**
   - Replace deprecated `on_event` handlers with modern lifespan events
   - Update Pydantic model usage to be compatible with both v1 and v2 (replace `.dict()` with `.model_dump()` where appropriate)

2. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - Implement retry mechanisms for external API calls (OpenAI, Stability)
   - Add circuit breakers for external dependencies
   - Enhance error reporting in UI with user-friendly messages

3. **Security Essentials**
   - Implement proper environment variable validation
   - Add input validation for all API endpoints
   - Configure CORS properly for production

### Testing Priority
- Implement unit tests for the orchestrator components, particularly focusing on workflow execution
- Create integration tests for the database repositories
- Test the WebSocket connections and status broadcasting
